## This repository is all about computer vision

#### It includes small projects on various computer vision topics, such as object detection, object tracking, classical computer vision techniques, image segmentation, feature extraction algorithms, and more.

#### Most of the projects have both C++ and Python implementations.

#### I will continue to update this repository with new content.

#### Each project includes an article that explains how the algorithm works, how the code is structured, provides general information about the algorithms, and much more.


#### You can find all the articles in the README files for each folder, and you can check all of my articles from this link: [https://medium.com/@siromermer](https://medium.com/@siromermer).

To test these projects in your local environment with C++, delete the build folder and rebuild it. This is necessary because the folder paths will change, because of that you need to rebuild the project.<br>
For python you can execute files directly
