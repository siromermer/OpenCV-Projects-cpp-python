## This repository is all about computer vision

##### It includes small projects on various computer vision topics, such as object detection, object tracking, classical computer vision techniques, image segmentation, image classification, feature extraction algorithms, and more.
##### Most of the projects have both C++ and Python implementations.
##### I will continue to update this repository with new content.
 

#### Each project includes an article that explains how the algorithm works, how the code is structured, provides general information about the algorithms, and much more.
### Right now, you can find all articles from my medium page, but everyday I am updating posts and uploading them to my new personal website, I recommend you to read from this link: https://visionbrick.com/
##### You can find all the articles in the README files for each folder, and you can check all of my articles from this link: [https://medium.com/@siromermer](https://medium.com/@siromermer).

To test these projects in your local environment with C++, delete the build folder and rebuild it. This is necessary because the folder paths will change, because of that you need to rebuild the project.<br>
For python you can execute files directly
