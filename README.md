### For each project, there is an implementation in both Python and C++ .<br> I have already written articles about this projects in medium
### You can read them for better understanding . Here is the link of articles :

To test these projects in your local environment with C++, delete the build folder and rebuild it. This is necessary because the folder paths will change, because of that you need to rebuild the project.<br>
For python you can execute files directly
